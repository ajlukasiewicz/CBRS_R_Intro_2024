## Course RStudio Servers

These links will take you to a CBRS server that hosts RStudio and Jupyter Notebook Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). 
RStudio on the CBRS computational server comes with several packages pre-installed that will facilitate our course moving along smoothly.
I will discuss local installation and setup of R and RStudio during class time, but it is recommended that you work within your profile within our class server to save instructional time.
